# jQuery/Postgresql To Do List App

Thanks for looking into my weekend project, the jQuery/Postgresql To Do List web app! 


## Description:

Duration: Weekend Sprint

This is a web based application that interacts with a virtual server and database to run a simple "To Do List" tracker.  The goal of this project was to get more hands on experience building an app that uses all CRUD functionality with a server and database running. 


## Prerequisites:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/

- Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/ 

- PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/


## Installation:

To run this program, you will need to:

- [] Build the database in your SQL server with the code in "database.sql" file. 

- [] Run 'npm install' in your terminal.

- [] Run 'npm start' in your terminal.


### Usage:

- #1. To use this app, start the server in your terminal.  Navigate to http://localhost:5000/ in your browser.  

- #2. It's auto-populated with four placeholder tasks (which are cheeky lyrics from a song).  Press the red trash icon to delete a row, or add your own rows with "Enter a Task Name" input field. 

- #3. Click the "completed" checkbox to mark a task as complete, which strikes through the text and changes it to green (success!). 

- #4. The tasks and completed history will persist through page refreshes and server restarts.  


### Built With:

JavaScript/HTML/CSS, jQuery, Node, Bootstrap, Ajax, PG.
